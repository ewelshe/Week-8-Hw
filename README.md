1. The role of the permanent magnet in a motor is to attract or repel the temporary magentetic feild that interacts with the permanent magnet's field. The temporary magnetism around a wire that is also connected to a battery, if connected to the permanent magnet, would cause the wire to jump. 
2. The role of brushes in a DC motor is to rub on a segmented copper ring so that the current through the armature coils alternate as the motor spins. 
3. I would use a brushless DC motor because it is more simple than the brushed motors. They replace brushes with associating sparks and noise with electric communication to switch the current flow to drive the motor. The brushless DC motor is commonly used in drones, multicopters, hybrid vehicles and they are quiet and efficient.
